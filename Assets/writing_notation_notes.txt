n = neutral
b = bad, it passing leads to +1 butterflies
g = good, it passing leads to -1 butterfly

c = character's outcome either way
d = npc's response

s = swap enemy sprite
   "Name" = name of sprite to swap to

r = repeating
   ("n"/"b"/"g") = type

p = pause
   # = int seconds

s = swap enemy sprite
   "Name" = sprite to change to
   "t"/"f" = if you want it to be faded

z = zero out b, for #

bs = branch begins
   id = identifying symbol
   # = if b >= # butterflies --> bb branch, 
       else --> bg branch
be = branch ends
bee = branching ends

bg[sym] = good branch begins for that sym
bb[sym] = bad branch begins for that sym

u = unique branch
   id = identifying string
   "line" = that flies at you
us = unique branch
   id = identifying string
ue = unique branch end

e = end
