TO CONSIDER:


- Are there colors better than green and red???
	- Color that implies "I don't know..."? Purple? Other?
	- Color that implies "Yes! I know!"? Gold? Other?

- A fog-like effect, with giant transparent clouds
floating across screen in head space. Metaphor for the
clouded mind.

- Should there be a ? over grey person sprite to indicate
you don't know who's talking, for special reveal?

- Changing font size to indicate size of emotion.

- Allowing female or male choice




- Where can I insert the person who is the reason for
social anxiety, the one who feeds it? From which the
specific fears come from? (the lines you hear people say
in your head)
      - A bully who makes their anxieties your anxieties

- Scene where a trigger -> Negative thought cycle 
(-> trying to self-calm)

- Scene where you are going off on an anxiety rampage and
the person you are talking to tells you to "slow down" ->
the words move slower and you can make your choices better

- Scene where you face your fears

- Warding off the bad thoughts as you try to articulate a
point

++ taking small risks of talking to people

NEUTRAL THOUGHTS
(random things that you can choose to work into conversation)
- a thing you notice

BAD THOUGHTS
(things that give you anxiety)
- something you fear the other person is thinking

GOOD THOUGHTS (rare)
(things that give you confidence)
- after you do something well



BEGINNING

- You begin by practicing a conversation in your head with
yourself. You have to do it over and over until you get it
right.
    - What is the "thing" you want to say to this person?
    - What are his reactions and how do they reflect
      other people's reactions?

- Your mom interrupts you, you have to go to school.

- You don't want to. You're afraid something will happen to
her while you're away

Possible lines from convo:
"What if something happens to you?"
"We have this conversation everyday."
"How do I look?" (afraid of being judged on appearance)
"Why don't I have any of 'X' clothes?"
"You're not just saying that, are you? (afraid mom is lying)
"No, I'm not." "Is something bothering you dear?"
"Want me to walk you to school?"



WALK TO SCHOOL
(build up)
(practice)
(establish a character that comes back later)



SCHOOL

- You are at your locker going over the plan and rehearsing
the conversation one more time before it happens.

- You are interrupted by a person you want to go away.
You have a very quick conversation. It is a person of
authority who you don't know and shakes you up. (hard)

(should there be a ? over grey person sprite to indicate
you don't know who's talking, for the reveal?)

- You go back to practicing.

- You are interrupted again. This time by the person you
were going to talk to. You have a quickish convo and
plan for something later. The person has hints of social
anxiety.

(insert transition)



???BEFORE BIG INTERACTION (DUSK)???

- You are at home finishing up eating with your mother.

- You go to the bathroom to wash up and prepare yourself.

- You leave. It is dusk.

- You walk through neighborhood. 


HANG OUT




END

You go back home and go to sleep.
